Sure Harsh! Here’s a simple, clear step-by-step guide to create a GitHub repository and upload your project (including your .ipynb file like Insurance_Practice_1.ipynb).

✅ How to Create a GitHub Repository (Step-by-Step)
1. Create a GitHub Account (if you don’t have one)
Visit: https://github.com
Sign up → Verify email → Login

2. Create a New Repository
After logging in, click + (top-right corner)

Select New repository

Fill details:

Repository name: (example: Insurance-ML-Analysis)

Description: "Practice notebook on ML insurance dataset"

Visibility: Public (or Private)

Click Create repository

✔ Your repo is created.

3. Upload Your Project Files
Once inside your new repo:

Click "Add file"

Select "Upload files"

Drag-drop your file:

Insurance_Practice_1.ipynb

And any CSV or Python file you have

Scroll down → Add commit message (example: “Initial commit”)

Click Commit changes

🎉 Your file is now uploaded to GitHub!

4. (Optional) Create Folder Structure
If your project has multiple files, use:

Add file → Create new file → name it: foldername/placeholder.txt
GitHub creates the folder.

5. (Optional) Clone Repo to Local System
If you want to work via VS Code:

Using HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
After editing
git add .
git commit -m "Updated notebook"
git push
✔ If you want, I can create a README.md for your GitHub repo
Just tell me:

Project name

What your notebook does

Any dataset details

Your GitHub username

I can generate a professional README for you.

✔ If you want, I can also create the folder structure and files here so you can directly upload them.
Would you like me to:
✅ Create a README.md for your repo?
✅ Suggest a repo name?
✅ Organize your uploaded .ipynb into a clean project structure?
